      A USER–CENTRED DESIGN APPROACH TO DRIVERLESS CARS<br>
      What will we want from driverless cars of the future? What are our human needs for the technology? We need to understand the answers to these questions so that we can design the technology in a way that can be adopted by all - not the fortunate few. Following the release of ustwo Auto’s second book, Humanising Autonomy: Where Are We Going?, Tim‘s talk draws on some of the key insights from the research and user testing that the book is built around and shows off some real world user–centred designs for driverless cars.

      Poker and business have a lot in common: the bad players often do not know, what kind of game they are even playing. Poker works great as a model for decision making. There is something to be gained (the pot in the middle), something you have to risk for it (by betting), all under time pressure and financial restraints, against competent competition, under uncertainty and incomplete information. Using Poker as a model, Jan Heitmann explains concepts and strategies used by world class poker players to make better decision under uncertainty.
